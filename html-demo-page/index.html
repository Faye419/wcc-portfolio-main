                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>FISH LOVE YOU is an interactive installation which creates ambiguous identities through new species of thousands of human and fish faces trained by StyleGAN. It embodies the equal relationship between humans and creatures from the perspective of artificial intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, the interaction between the goldfish and the viewer and the short film on the small screen create a sensual atmosphere. I hope that technology will help us understand fish and expand the sensory interaction between humans and fish. 
                    Finally, this project suggests a shift from anthropocentrism to a post-humanism worldview, advocating a new form of coexistence between humans and nature.

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                <h4>Animism </h4>
                <p> Animism beliefs recognize that all things in this world are intelligent and have agency.(Yolanda, 2021)
                    Animism facilitates an empathic rather than anobjective mechanistic and reductionstic approach to human health and prosperity. (Fox, 1995)
                    Therefore, all living things have spirit, and fish have their own spirit and soul. What we meet daily are meaningful objects, which means they have been endowed with significance by the spirit. Every individual has its identity and is not food or pet for human to their life purpose.
                    Animism therefore requires a strong sense of compassion.(Russell, 2020) Empathy, on the other hand, is the most primitive communication technique of all things.
                    Therefore, I focused on the emotional connection between humans and fish to evoking empathy for fish. Firstly, it is important to promote an equal relationship between humans and fish.…another aspect of the nature/culture binary, one that has positioned humans as expressive agents (active) and to position nonhumans as those with nothing to express (passive)…One of the problems has been that of equating communication, or expression, with language. (Rose, 2013)
                    It has always been the case that the goldfish as a pet represents the object, the one being viewed by the human (the subject). This relationship goes back to a human-centred in the environment. However, I believe that under the concept of biological equality, this subject-object relationship should be weakened, in short, realising that while we are viewing the goldfish, people are also being gazed at by them. It's a two-way communication and emotional output that has nothing to do with language.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Anthropocentrism to post-humanism </h4>
                <p> Anthropocentrism literally means human-centered…In contradistinction, all other beings hold value only in their ability to serve humans, or in their instrumental value.(Goralnik,2012)
                    I have not used non-anthropocentris here, which in my opinion cannot be understood as an exclusionary concept, but rather as an expansive one, which means it denotes the centrality of a wider range of objects (all higher animals, all living organisms, or entire ecosystems), including human beings.
                    For a long time, we thought we were the masters of the world. But now we are discovering that even fungi can have their own way of communicating, so the anthropocentric way we imagined is an outdated notion. According to post-humanism, we need to stop thinking of ourselves as superior to other creatures on earth and accept that we are part of nature.
                    ...The human face evolved from the fish face.(Yan, 2016) According to the theory, I thought about the similarities between humans and fish. So I used StyleGAN to mix fish and human images as a dataset, had the AI recognise this mixed dataset in the same way it learns faces, and then observed the AI's vision of the images as it learnt them.
                    Characters and fish elemental amalgamated forms are again vague identities compared to absolute specific characters. The aim is to address our tendency to see our species as unique and distinct from other life forms.</p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

                <!-- example of styling for three images, you can write your own styling -->
            
                <h4>Body Recognition </h4>
                <p> I purchased a model of a fish with texture from a website, but when I opened it I found the texture very confusing. So I retextured it and did a 5-second swimming animation. Then I rendered it with the OC renderer. I remember that I spent a lot of time debugging OC renderer, because the fish's body is too red to see the details.
                    Finally, I used PROCESSING to make the webcam capture the viewer's body movement. I want to have different-sized fish move following the viewer's movement.  </p>

                        <div class="flex-item">
                            <img src="../assets/images/fish model.jpg"/>
                        </div>
                        <div class="flex-item">
                            <img src="../assets/images/processing.jpg"/>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h4>StyleGAN  </h4>
                    <p> At first, I wanted to use Diffusion and pix2pix to generate the video. Diffusion could linguistically generate some combination of patterns and faces, but it wasn't random and couldn't illustrate my concept, so I dropped the idea.
                        Try Diffusion 
                        
                        I was very clear about the effect I wanted to achieve - a hybrid of human faces and fish faces. I searched for the dataset on Kaggle. However, I encountered some difficulties while looking for fish faces.
                        At first, I trained with 600 fish. Due to few samples and complex backgrounds, StyleGAN2 couldn't distinguish the backgrounds and faces. 
                        So, I found more than 1,500 fish faces with plain backgrounds on Instagram and used code to cut out the images to normalize the images to be uniform. 
                        Despite many attempts, StyleGAN2 was not worked well, so I decided to use StyleGAN1. Unlike StyleGAN2, StyleGAN1 is trained from 4*4 *8 16*16 32*32 64*64 128*128 256*256 size by size. The source code reference for StyleGAN1 is from Kim Seonghyeon.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Video </h4>
                        <p> I made a short film to show the relationship between humans and humans, humans and fish, and fish and fish. I isnvited my classmates to star in the film, and the empty footage was shot by me on the beach in China. Finally, I spent a week editing the video on PR.</p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>I'm generally satisfied with the work. It was a new experiment and challenge because I didn't take related courses. I learnt about StyleGAN and became interested in hybrid organisms, which will be a new direction for me. 
                    Unfortunately, I didn't use StyleGAN2 due to my computer configuration and dataset, so the presentation was not as good as expected. Moreover, the number of samples of my fish and faces did not match, resulting in most randomly generated ones still being faces. In addition, according to the feedback, my camera couldn't recognise the human body due to the dark light, which reminds me to do more tests on the display in the future.
                    Regarding the exhibition, my teacher suggested that I put the iPad on the other wall so that the audience would have a multi-dimensional viewing perspective.
                    Finally, I hope to have time to learn Arduino so that the audience can interact with the fish tank. Adding interactivity is my goal.</p>
